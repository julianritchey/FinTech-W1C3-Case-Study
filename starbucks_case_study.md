# How Starbucks Wants to Connect Coffee Consumers with Coffee Producers #

### Background ###
Starbucks is a multinational coffeehouse chain that was founded in 1971 in Seattle, Washington. The company initially sold only coffee beans and coffee-making equipment but soon started serving coffee as well. Today, Starbucks is one of the world's largest coffeehouse chains, with more than 32,000 locations in 83 countries.

Starbucks is best known for its high-quality coffee, as well as its cozy, inviting atmosphere that encourages people to spend time in their stores. The company serves a wide variety of coffee beverages, as well as tea, pastries, sandwiches, and other snacks.

Starbucks' competitors include other large coffee chains such as Dunkin' Donuts, Costa Coffee, Tim Hortons, and Peet's Coffee, as well as smaller, independent coffee shops. In recent years, fast food chains such as McDonald's and Burger King have also entered the coffee market, offering their own coffee and breakfast menus to compete with Starbucks.

### FinTech involvement ###
Starbucks is considered a technology leader in the food and beverage industry, with several digital initiatives that have helped the company streamline operations, improve the customer experience, and increase sales. Some of the ways that Starbucks uses technology to their advantage include:
1. Mobile ordering and payment: Starbucks has a mobile app that allows customers to order and pay for their drinks ahead of time, reducing wait times and increasing convenience.
2. Loyalty program: Starbucks has a rewards program that rewards customers with points for purchases made with the mobile app or physical Starbucks Card. This incentivizes customers to make repeat purchases and helps Starbucks gather data on customer preferences.
3. Data analytics: Starbucks uses data analytics to understand customer behavior, including which products are most popular, when and where people are buying, and which promotions are driving sales.
4. Digital partnerships: Starbucks has formed partnerships with companies like Spotify and Uber to integrate their services into the Starbucks mobile app, creating a seamless experience for customers.
Due to its focus on digital innovation and mobile payment technology, Starbucks is often considered a FinTech company. However, it's worth noting that while Starbucks does use financial technology to improve the customer experience, it is primarily a coffee company with a strong digital presence, rather than a pure FinTech firm.

Starbucks is teaming up with msft to track coffee bean production. This helps them conform to ethically sourced beans.
"In 2015, Starbucks announced it had reached an industry milestone of 99 percent ethically sourced coffee, consciously leaving the remaining 1 percent to allow for discovery and work in new origins. Any company can claim to source sustainably, and many do, but transparency is key to those commitments, and technology is key to transparency, Burns said."
